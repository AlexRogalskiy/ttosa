# Time Till Open Source Alternative

## Dataset

Each row corresponds to a proprietary software who has had a *direct* open source alternative, and the "TTOSA" is the difference between the birth date of those two projects.

A **direct open source alternative** is defined as an open source project that was created in direct inspiration from the proprietary software, and often clearly presenting itself as a replacement to that.

The birth date (second column) of a proprietary software is the founding date of the company that created the software, or otherwise the "initial date" for the project's lifespan.

The birth date (fourth column) of an open source alternative is the date of its initial Git commit, or otherwise a similar "initial date" for the project's lifespan.

TTOSA is the numerical difference between the fourth and the second columns, measured in days.
